# Analytics workspace

> [Introduced](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ee/issues/12077) in GitLab 12.2.

The Analytics workspace will make it possible to aggregate analytics across
GitLab, so that users can view information across multiple projects and groups
in one place.

To access the centralized analytics workspace, you need to enable at least one of the features under the workspace (please see 'Available analytics'). Once this is done, please click on **Analytics** from the top navigation bar.

## Available analytics

From the centralized analytics workspace, the following analytics are available:

- [Cycle Analytics](cycle_analytics.md). To enable, please turn `cycle_analytics` on.**(PREMIUM)**
- [Productivity Analytics](productivity_analytics.md). To enable, please turn `productivity_analytics` on. **(PREMIUM)**

NOTE: **Note:**
Project-level Cycle Analytics are still available at a project's **Project > Cycle Analytics**.

## Other analytics tools

In addition to the tools available in the Analytics workspace, GitLab provides:

- [Contribution analytics](../group/contribution_analytics/index.md). **(STARTER)**
